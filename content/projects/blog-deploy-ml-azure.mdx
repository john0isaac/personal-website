We will start by creating a resource group inside the Azure Platform and then creating an Azure Machine Learning Workspace, Compute, and Notebook. 
Inside the notebook, we will run some code that will help us to build, save, package, register, and deploy our Machine Learning Model. 
In addition, We will use the Power Apps template that I created to trigger a Power Automate Cloud Flow to consume the deployed model, make requests, and ingest responses.
